The abalone dataset comes from an original (non-machine-learning) study: Warwick J Nash -  "The Population Biology of Abalone...". This is a regression problem. The goal was to predict the age of an abalone, given its sex and laboratory measurements such as length or viscera weight. The notebook shows subsequent steps of my very own full data science project, together with the comments explaining each cell written. I described in detail each of the smaller tasks such as data exploration, implementing two supervised learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation. I also compared my results with the ones achieved by the previous authors mentioned in the abalone_names.txt file.
